This code represents a basic smart contract called "MyToken" for a cryptocurrency token. Here's a brief explanation of its key elements:

The contract defines two public variables:

1. tokenName represents the name of the token and is set to "META".
2. tokenAbbrv represents the abbreviation of the token and is set to "MTA".
3. totalSupply represents the total supply of the token and is initially set to 0.
4. The contract includes a mapping variable called balances. It maps addresses to their corresponding token balances. The balances mapping allows you to store and retrieve the balance of a specific address.

The contract provides two functions:

1. The mint function is used to create new tokens and assign them to a specific address. It takes two parameters: _address (the address to which the tokens will be assigned) and _value (the amount of tokens to be created and assigned). It increases the totalSupply by the specified _value and updates the balance of _address accordingly.
2. The burn function is used to remove existing tokens from a specific address. It takes the same parameters as the mint function. It checks if the address has sufficient tokens to burn (remove), and if so, decreases the totalSupply and updates the balance of the _address accordingly.

In summary, this code defines a token contract that allows you to create new tokens (mint) and remove existing tokens (burn) while keeping track of token balances for different addresses.
